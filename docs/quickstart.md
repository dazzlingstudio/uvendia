# Quickstart
## Installation


### Database

### Connection string
By ``default`` **Uvendia** will always take the **Umbraco** connection string named ``umbracoDbDSN``. But in case you want your **Uvendia** database table to be created on a separate database, you can configured another connection string with the name ``unvendiaDbDSN``.

## Cloudinary
Make sure you have an active account on [Cloudinary](/settings/cloudinary.md)

## Settings
Before starting creating your assets, make sure you have all your settings configured. Take a look at the ``Settings`` sections.
